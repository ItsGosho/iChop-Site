# Guest

The guest Navigation is way different than the other.When the **Sign In** is clicked

![Closed](../../../.gitbook/assets/navbar_guest_closed.png)

the login will appear as pretty **Dropdown** form

![Login](../../../.gitbook/assets/navbar_guest_login.png)

and next we can **Register** or **Reset our password**

![Register](../../../.gitbook/assets/navbar_guest_register.png)

![Forgotten Password](../../../.gitbook/assets/navbar_guest_forgotten_password.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Again we are using _Redux_ ,but this time to manage ,which form is shown to the User ,because the Component are separated with each other and we don't want to prop drill them :\)
{% endhint %}
